    <p>Visual Studio Code is a freeware source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.[9] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.
        Microsoft has released Visual Studio Code's source code on the microsoft/vscode (Code - OSS) repository of GitHub, under the permissive MIT License,[5][10] while the releases by Microsoft are freeware.[7]

    <p>Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen). The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. The text mode is unavailable in Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.</p>
